# AudioPlayer

This project was developed in a study on the audio elements of html
The initial project itself, came from [rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat/youtube-html-js-audio-player)

## The player was developed using: 
  - Html
  - Css (framework materialize)
  - JavaScript
  
Luckily I like to make a noise, and I used my songs on the player. :grin:
